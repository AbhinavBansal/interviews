Code related to technical interview questions
---------------------------------------------

See the tests to get a better idea of how to use the methods. I tried to comment whenever there were some tricks involved.

All the code corresponds to my answer to the question and should not be taken as granted. Technical interviews are about discussion and refinements of a first brute force yet well-implemented solution.
